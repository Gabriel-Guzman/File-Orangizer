	Thanks for downloading the File Orangizer! This program allows you to organize your 
folders of pictures, music, documents, or any file by tags that you add. This program is a
java executable; to run it, you must have Java installed on your computer, preferably the most
recent release of Java.

	About the program:
This program can be placed anywhere in your computer. No installation needed, but it will
automatically create a subfolder called "FileOrganism." Within the folder, there will be 
one file which stores your tags, directories you chose to use, and states of those folders
from the last time the program saved. If the save file "directories.ser" is deleted, the 
program will create a new, blank one.
	
	About the tags system:
Tags, similar to "hashtags" on other platforms and allow for files to be sorted by user-
given attributes instead of being organized by folder. This allows for files to appear for
multiple different search queries. One could organize a picture of a dog by the tag "dog"
and the tag "animal," and the picture would appear for both search queries. Tags can contain
any character, but any extra spaces will be trimmed.

	How to use:
Once you open the program from the command line or from double-clicking FileOrangizer.jar, 
a subdirectory "FileOrganism" and a save file "directories.ser" will be created. You will then
see the program on your screen.
	- Adding a directory:
To organize the files in a directory, you must first add it to your list of directories. To do
this, click "Add directory" on the bottom right of the open program.
	- Adding tags to your files
Once you have added at least one directory, select one directory to open and edit the files of.
Once you have selected one, click the "Edit tags" button. This will open a file chooser. In the
file chooser, you may select one or multiple files (by holding ctrl and clicking) to edit the 
tags of. You will get a different editing window depending on the amound of files you select.
		~ One file selected
	If you have one file selected, you will be presented with a window to edit that file's
	tags. On the left, you have a list of the tags you have already added to it. To add
	tags, type the tags you want to add in the text field separated by commas. Once you
	click "add tags," they will be automatically parsed and added to the file. 
	
	To remove tags, highlight all the tags you want to remove. Then either click
	"remove tags" or right-click and select the "remove tags" option.

		~ Multiple files selected
	If you have selected more than one file, you will be presented with a pop-up window
	to add tags to the files you have selected. To add the tags, type them into the text
	field separated by commas.
